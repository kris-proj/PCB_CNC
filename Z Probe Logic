1 - Create config file with gear ratio, thread pitch, steps per revolution
2 - Define the grid size of the "probe area"
      grid x length by grid y length (can be converted to steps)
3 - Define how many peices to divide the grid into
      this may end up being irrationation, so floor value
4 - Determine the x and y "grid marks" (i.e. what points on x and y axis define the grid lines)
