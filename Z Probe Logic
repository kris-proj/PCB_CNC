1 - Create config file with gear ratio, thread pitch, steps per revolution
2 - Define the grid size of the "probe area"
      grid x length by grid y length (can be converted to steps)
3 - Define how many peices to divide the grid into
      this may end up being irrationation, so floor value
4 - Determine the x and y "grid marks" (i.e. what points on x and y axis define the grid lines)
      use the grid size and divide by how many pieces\
      this may lead to irrational values; floor the entire array (only integer steps)

This yields an array of x and y values to probe (probe all combinations of x and y to define a full grid)

5 - Create Z of size N x M where N is the size of x value array and M is the size of y value array
6 - Run through the algorithm:

      For all values of x and for all values of y:
            Send CNC to position x,y
                  Send position command and wait for OK
            Send CNC command to probe at position x,y
                  Send probe command and wait for Z height
            Store Z height data in Z matrix
